# Python - Excel Power User

Assumption:

* You have experience with reports in Excel, using Macros, and limited VB exposure

## Iteration 1

Plan - we will learn how to use Python working with data.

1. Basics of Python and Jupyther Notebook
2. How to manipulate tabular data
3. How to visualize the tabular data
4. Your workstation - setup your local Jupyther environment
5. Use your knowledge to work with a tabular data of your choice
6. Create a Github account and learn basic git commands
7. Write a simple web app

Steps:

1. Do the Python tutorial at Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python. You can also check: [intro to programming](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-programming)

2. You will now see how to work with tabular data, a bit how you worked with Excel but better ;) - https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas

3. How you can learn about data if you cannot modify it - https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization

4. Setup your local development environment:

   - [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
   - [Jupyter in WSL2](https://towardsdatascience.com/configuring-jupyter-notebook-in-windows-subsystem-linux-wsl2-c757893e9d69)

5. You can read to Pandas, an excel file and practise modifing the data and visualizing it. An alternative is, look for Pandas exercises: https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises

6. You might not need the git now, but it is an excercise to teach you how to install tooling:

   - [wsl-git](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git) - install and configure, skip the rest
   - https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github 
   - https://github.com/wojciech11/se_software_build_automation_tools/blob/master/01_exercise/README_pl.md

7. Write a simple web app - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/python/web-frameworks
